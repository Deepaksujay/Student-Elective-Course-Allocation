# Student-Elective-Course-Allocation
The Student Elective Course Selection Management system is designed to simplify the process of managing student elective course selections in Excel using Google Apps Script. It provides administrators with a tool to streamline the allocation of elective courses to students efficiently.    


If anyones wants to replicate our project into  thier own spreadsheet, there is no simple import possible as of now for google script files. One turnaround is to copy the code from our Code Folder and copy paste them in your spreadsheet apps script.  

More information on importing the code files can be found in the following link: https://support.google.com/docs/thread/142975260/connecting-an-existing-app-script-to-a-new-spread-sheet?hl=en
